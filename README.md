## Sample Assignment

Your first step will be to work through a sample assignment so that you can become familiar with R and understand what a sample assignment looks like.  Start by opening up the file `assignments/assignment00/assignment00_LastnameFirstname.R`.  The file contains comments with instructions (comment lines start with one or more \# characters) and code fragments. Usually, underscore characters (`___`) are used as placeholders.    To complete the assignments, you will be expected to replace the placeholders with working code. 

When you are working on an assignment, you should make a copy of any template files to the corresponding assignment folder in the `completed` directory.  Change the name of the file to include your first and last name instead of `_LastnameFirstname.R`.  `completed/assignment00/assignment00_DoeJohn.R` provides a completed example of the sample assignment for student John Doe.  

## Expected Outcome Files

Some assignments contain expected outcome file(s) in the `completed` directory. When present, use these files to check to make sure the output of your assignment matches the expected outcome found in the `completed` directory for that assignment.
